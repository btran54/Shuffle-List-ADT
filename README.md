Goal:=============================================================================

Our goal in this project is to create a new, and somewhat different integer List ADT, this time in C++. We will use this List to perform shuffling operations, and determine how many shuffles are necessary to bring a List back into its original order

Files:=============================================================================

List.h - List header file containing the forward declaration of list functions

List.cpp - List CPP file containing the operation of functions

ListTest.cpp - List test file containing the testing of operations from List.cpp

Shuffle.cpp - Shuffle file containing the main execution of List.cpp functions

Makefile - File used to automate build process

README.md - Documentation of included files
